            <p>The title describes Trevor's struggle with his mixed heritage and the societal constraints imposed on
                him
                <br>while highlighting his quest for self-definition.

            <h4>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                subservient women… 'He only wants a <br>woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
            </h4>
            <div class="reflection">

                <p>Personal Reflection:<br><br>The quote from a “Born a Crime”,which discusses Abel’s desire for a
                    traditional marriage yet his
                    contradiction in seeking a free woman to confine,resonates deeply with contemporary discussions
                    around gender roles and relationship expectations.It reflects a contradict prevalent in many modern
                    relationships where traditional ideals clash with the evolving understanding of partnership and
                    equality,not because he respected women's freedom, but because he saw them as more easily
                    dominated.Also, Abel's desire to control others is a manifestation of his own lack of self-control,
                    as
                    suggested in the book. He sees women as opportunities to exert his authority and create a "cage" of
                    dependency.<br><br>

                    Nowadays,there is often an expectation for women to express independence and excellence.Many men
                    express a desire for strong,independent partners but at the same time uphold traditional gender
                    norms that limit women’s autonomy.This leads to relationships where one partner feels forced despite
                    the outward appearance of freedom.<br><br></p>

            <h2>Real-life reflection</h2>
            <p>In my own circle,I have seen relationships where men celebrate their partners’ achievements but
                struggle with the idea of their partner being more successful than they are.The desire for equality
                creates tension in relationships.Just because a man sees and praises your amazing talent doesn't mean
                he's the one. He should be your biggest fan, helping you to succeed to new heights.Obviously, also
                kicking his own life goals and not expecting you to be the breadwinner,cleaner,cook,primary parent,
                etc.<br><br>
                The rise of discussions around toxic manliness sheds light on how societal pressures can distort
                men’s perceptions of love and partnership.Many men are conditioned to view vulnerability as
                weakness,leading them to seek partners who fit into their preconceived notions of femininity rather
                than embracing mutual respect and partnership.<br><br>

                Misunderstandings create distance.Threfore,having respect for eachother and valuing one's presence helps
                to connect people or partners leaving ego. </p>
